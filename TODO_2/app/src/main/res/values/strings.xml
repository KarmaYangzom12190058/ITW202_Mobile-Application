        Anthology 1 is a compilation album by the Beatles, released on 20 November 1995 by Apple Records as part of The Beatles Anthology series.
            It features rarities, outtakes and live performances from the period 1958–64, including songs with original bass player Stuart Sutcliffe
            and drummer Pete Best.
            It is the first in a trilogy of albums with Anthology 2 and Anthology 3, all of which tie in with the televised special The Beatles Anthology.
            It contains Free as a Bird, billed as the first new Beatles song in 25 years, which was released as a single two weeks after Anthology 1.

        The album includes material from the Beatles through the Decca audition to sessions for the album Beatles for Sale.
            It is of historical interest as the only official release of performances with Best and Sutcliffe in the band - Sutcliffe,
            the bands original bass player during 1960, and sporadically during the groups second Hamburg season,
            appears on the disc-one tracks Hallelujah, I Love Her So, You wll Be Mine and Cayenne;
            while Best, who was the official drummer from just prior to the groups first departure for Hamburg
            in August 1960 until 15 August 1962 when he was replaced by Ringo Starr, is on Disc One, tracks 10–12, 15–19 and 21–22.

        The cover of Anthology 1 is the first third of the Anthology collage made by Klaus Voormann and Alfons Kiefer.
        Various photographs and album covers are torn and collected together.
        Pete Bests face was torn away from the Savage Young Beatles record jacket in the centre of the album cover,
        revealing the face of his successor, Ringo Starr, below.
        The bottom leftmost photograph on the Anthology 1 cover does feature an unobscured Best.

        The Anthology albums were remastered and made available digitally on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011,
        individually and as part of the Anthology Box Set.

        Disc One, tracks 10–12, were recorded at a session in Hamburg where the Beatles served as the back-up band to the English rock
            and roll musician Tony Sheridan. Some songs from this session were released on the 1962 album My Bonnie,
            credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers. The song My Bonnie would be their introductory single in England,
            featuring Sheridan on lead vocal and guitar.
            Tracks 21–22 are the only surviving recordings of the Beatles first EMI session.
            Track 22 is the original recording of Love Me Do, which would be re-recorded by the group four months later for their first single.
            Track 24 features EMI session drummer Andy White, in place of Ringo.
            Disc Two contains performances from comedy duo Morecambe and Wises popular television programme,
            Two of a Kind, as well as the opening song from their famed performance on The Ed Sullivan Show,
            which introduced the band to most of the US in 1964.

        The flash-point for the album came with the song Free as a Bird – the three remaining Beatles Paul McCartney,
            George Harrison and Ringo Starr reworking a John Lennon demo recording given to McCartney by Lennons widow,
            Yoko Ono. Produced by Harrisons Traveling Wilburys bandmate Jeff Lynne, the three added additional music and lyrics,
            instrumentation and backing vocals, with McCartney and Harrison both taking a turn at a lead vocal.
            The live BBC Radio recording of Lend Me Your Comb was held back from Live at the BBC
            for inclusion on this album, but it was later also included on On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2.
